Short script to spam the Whitehouse's "Reorganizing the Executive Branch" survey with automated responses.
[Reorganizing the Executive Branch](https://www.whitehouse.gov/reorganizing-the-executive-branch)

Tested on OSX bash

`nope.sh` - no changes, user information is randomized
`burn.sh` - everything to be reformed, user information is randomized
`rando.sh` - a few random selections are made, user information is randomized

## How do I use it?

Mac OS:

Open terminal located in `/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app`
Navigate to the folder the scripts are located. You can do this by typing `cd` space and then drag and drop the folder containing the scripts and pressing enter.
You'll have to add permissions to the scripts by entering:
`chmod +x burn.sh nope.sh rando.sh`
Then you can execute the scripts by entering:
`./nope.sh`
