Here's a code example from the GOP's survey:

<div class="form-field-body">
	<ul id="id_question_3251">
		<li><label for="id_question_3251_0"><input id="id_question_3251_0" name="question_3251" type="radio" value="Donald J. Trump" /> Donald J. Trump</label></li>
		<li><label for="id_question_3251_1"><input id="id_question_3251_1" name="question_3251" type="radio" value="Hillary Clinton" /> Hillary Clinton</label></li>
	</ul>
</div>

observations:
the following
clicking on the radio button for Donald J. Trump on the website selected the following:
	id = id_question_3251_0
	value = Donald J. Trump
This is likely what our curl submission would have to provide.
We dealt with this previous with the line of code:
	QBODY="$QBODY -F 'id_question_"$QNUM"_"$RESPONSE_NUM"=$RESPONSE'"
Where QBODY is the data field for the curl command; QNUM is matched to the questionaire's id value less the value of the $RESPONSE_NUM, and $RESPONSE is the text in the "value" field.
The result would be something like id_question_3251_0=Donald J. Trump
After looking into forms from the client and server sides, I don't think this is the correct usage.
I think only the 'name' and 'value' get sent to the server

Code examples from the Whitehouse.gov's survey:

Simple field for first name
<div class="form-item webform-component webform-component-sf-firstname webform-component--first-name">
  <label for="edit-submitted-first-name">First Name <span class="form-required" title="This field is required.">*</span></label>
 <input required="required" type="text" id="edit-submitted-first-name" name="submitted[first_name]" value="" size="60" maxlength="40" class="form-text required">
</div>

More complex field with multiple selection:
<div  class="form-item webform-component webform-component-select webform-component--cabinet-agencies">

	NOTE: The above formatting was done manually. I spent several hours finding a way to insert new lines between characters. This was the best I could come up with, a two step replace using sed:
	$ sed s/"><"/">å<"/g filename > temp_filename
	$ sed $'s/å/\\\n/g' temp_filename > filename_tidy
	first step replaces >< with å
	second step replaces å with \n
